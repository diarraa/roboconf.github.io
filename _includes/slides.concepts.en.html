	<h3>The Graph</h3>
	<p>
		The graph defines Software elements and their relations.<br />
		Software elements include virtual machines, application servers, application packages... whatever.
		They are called <strong>components</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Two kinds of relations are considered.
	</p>

	<h4>Containment</h4>
	<p>
		A component has to be deployed onto another one.<br />
		<small>Example: a war onto a web application server.</small>
	</p>

	<h4>Runtime</h4>
	<p>
		A component needs another one to run.<br />
		A component provides a feature another component may need.
		<small>Example: a war application needs a MySQL database.</small>
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Containment Example</h3>
	<img src="../../resources/img/graph-containment-example.jpg" alt="Example" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		We can deploy Tomcat either on an Amazon VM, or on an Azure VM.<br />
		And we can deploy given applications only on Tomcat. 
		If we wanted to deploy a third web application, we would have to update the graph.
	</p>
	<p>
		Containment can be recursive. Tomcat is here both contained and a container.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Runtime Example</h3>
	<img src="../../resources/img/graph-runtime-example.jpg" alt="Example" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		Here shows a mix of containment relations with a runtime dependency.<br />
		In this graph, <strong>App 2</strong> depends on a MySQL database, which is not the case of <strong>App 1</strong>.
		It means Roboconf cannot start <strong>App 2</strong> until it has the <strong>ip</strong> and <strong>port</strong>
		of a MySQL database. 
	</p>

	<h3>Benefits of the Graph</h3>
	<p>For a given Software component...</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We know what can be deployed on it.</li>
		<li>We know on what it can be deployed.</li>
		<li>We know which other components it depends on.</li>
	</ul>

	<br /><br />
	<h3>Practical Use</h3>
	<p>When we want to deploy a new Software component...</p>
	<ul>
		<li>... we can deploy it on an existing container.</li>
		<li>... we can create its container at the same time.</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>The Graph(s)</h3>
	<p>
		The graph is a structure with two levels of reading (containment and runtime relations).
		It is a set of rules that will drive deployments and reconfiguration.
	</p>
	<p>
		But unlike what the previous slides let think, there is not only one graph.
		Indeed, several graphs can be defined in the configuration files.
	</p>
	<p>
		Thus, it is possible to define pseudo-appliances.<br />
		It means deployments can be made very flexible or very constrained.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is useful because those that develop an application or plan its
		deployment are not those who effectively deploy and manage it in production.
		Constraining deployment of scalable parts reduces the risk of errors by the production team. 
	</p>

	<h3>Lax Graph</h3>
	<img src="../../resources/img/graph-lamp-lax-example.jpg" alt="lax graph" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		We here consider the 3 main applications (Apache load balancer, Tomcat and MySQL) can be deployed over
		a same VM, or at least, on VM of the same &laquo; type &raquo;.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Appliance-like Graphs</h3>
	<img src="../../resources/img/graph-lamp-constrained-example.jpg" alt="constrained graph" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		Here, we consider each of the 3 main applications must be deployed on their own VM type. 
		It means we cannot deploy different applications on a given VM.
	</p>
	<p>
		Every VM type can have its own template and configuration (tailored CPU, RAM, storage, operating system, network configuration...).
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Recipes</h3>
	<p>
		Every component in the graph is associated with a set of recipes.<br />
		More exactly, every component in the graph is associated with a plug-in (&laquo; installer &raquo;).
	</p>
	<p>
		A component associated with the <strong>Puppet</strong> installer will use a Puppet module as its recipe.
		A component associated with the <strong>Bash</strong> installer will use a set of Bash scripts.
	</p>
	<p>
		Recipes define the actions to undertake when an administration decision was sent.
		It matches life cycle steps: deploy, start, stop and undeploy.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is also a step called <strong>update</strong>.<br />
		It is invoked automatically by Roboconf on reconfiguration. This is discussed farther.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Instances</h3>
	<p>
		Instances means &laquo; instances of components from the graph &raquo;.<br />
		The graph is a set of rules. It could be seen as a meta-model for instances.
		So, instances comply with what was defined in the graph.
	</p>
	<p>
		Another comparison could be classes and instances from Object-Oriented Programming.
	</p>
	<p>
		Instances inherit properties from their component.<br />
		They can override them, and even define new ones (local scope).
		Their relations with other instances are ruled by the graph(s).
	</p>
	<p>
		An instance is associated with a single component.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Application Meta-data</h3>
	<p>
		A Roboconf project is called an application.<br />
		It comes with the definition of graphs and predefined instances.
	</p>
	<p>
		But it also has some information about the application itself.<br />
		Name, description, qualifier (version)...
	</p>
