	<h3>Project Structure</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			descriptor/
			<ul>
				<li>application.properties</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			graph/
			<ul>
				<li>*.graph</li>
				<li>1 directory per component (for its recipes)</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			instances/
			<ul>
				<li>*.instances</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<br /><br />
	<p>
		The graph is defined in <strong>*.graph</strong> files.<br />
		The description can be split in several files, for modularity.<br />
		The same thing applies to <strong>*.instances</strong> files.
	</p>
	<p>
		This structure can also be ported into a Maven structure,
		for a combined use with the Roboconf Maven plugin.
	</p>
</section>

	<h3>Graph Files - 1/5</h3>
	<p>
		These files use a custom syntax, inspired from CSS.<br />
		They are readable and editable easily through any text editor.
		They are less verbose than XML, and less error-prone than YAML.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="roboconf" data-trim>
# A component called 'MyComponentName'
MyComponentName {
    installer: bash;
}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		Comments and properties must fit on a single line.<br />
		<strong>installer</strong> is the extension Roboconf will use to deploy,
		start, stop and undeploy instances of this component. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Every component has an associated directory that contains recipes or resources.
		These resources are used by the Roboconf extension identified by the <strong>installer</strong> name.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Graph Files - 2/5</h3>
	<p>
		An important aspect of components are imports and exports.<br />
		They are variables that a component exposes or requires.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="roboconf" data-trim>
# WebApplication exports "WebApplication.ip".
WebApplication {
	exports: ip;
	imports: MySQL.ip, MySQL.port;
}

# MySQL exports "MySQL.ip" and "MySQL.port".
MySQL {
	exports: ip, port = 3306;
}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		If a component imports a variable, then another component in the graph must export it.
		A component instance cannot start unless all its imports are resolved.
	</p>
	<p>
		Every time a component instance appears or leaves, it notifies those that import
		its variables. The notified instances can then take proper actions through their recipes.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Graph Files - 3/5</h3>
	<p>
		It is possible to define optional imports.<br />
		Optional imports mean a component can start, even if these imports are not resolved.
		But it will be notified if they appear.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="roboconf" data-trim>
# A cluster node.
ClusterNode {
	exports: ip, port = 18741;
	imports: ClusterNode.ip (optional), ClusterNode.port (optional);
}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		In this example, the cluster node can start if it is alone.
		And it will be notified when other nodes appear or disappear.
	</p>
	<p>
		When a component instance is started, and that one of its dependencies disappear,
		Roboconf stops it and puts it in the <strong>starting</strong> state. If the dependency
		comes back, it will automatically be started.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>ip</strong> is a special variable whose value is set automatically by Roboconf.<br />
		Any other exported variable must have a default value.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Graph Files - 4/5</h3>
	<p>
		Imports and exports deal with runtime dependencies.<br />
		Containment relations are handled through the <strong>children</strong> key word.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="roboconf" data-trim>
# Tomcat and MySQL are other graph components
VM_Tomcat {
	children: Tomcat;
}

VM_MySQL {
	children: MySQL;
}

VM_All {
	children: Tomcat, MySQL;
}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		<strong>children</strong> lists components that can be deployed
		over an instance of this component. It can be very constrained or quite flexible.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Graph Files - 5/5</h3>
	<p>
		Sometimes, components share properties.<br />
		It is possible to group properties into a <strong>facet</strong>.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="roboconf" data-trim>
# Facets
facet VM {
	children: deployable;
	installer: target;
}

facet deployable {
	installer: puppet;
	exports: ip;
}
	</code></pre>
	<pre><code class="roboconf" data-trim>
# Components
VM_EC2 {
	facets: VM;
}

VM_Azure {
	facets: VM;
}

Tomcat {
	facets: deployable;
}
	</code></pre>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Recipes - 1/3</h3>
	<p>
		Recipes are resources used by a Roboconf plug-in to manage the
		life cycle of component instances.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="roboconf" data-trim>
VM_EC2 {
	installer: target;
}

VM_Openstack {
	installer: target;
}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This graph implies there will be two directories in the graph, called
		<strong>VM_EC2</strong> and <strong>VM_Openstack</strong>. Because these components
		use the <strong>target</strong> installer, these directories will contain a 
		<strong>target.properties</strong> file.
	</p>
	<p>
		One will have parameters to handle VM on EC2.<br />
		The other one will contain parameters related to Openstack.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Recipes - 2/3</h3>
	<p>
		Here is an example of <strong>target.properties</strong>.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="bash" data-trim>
# These properties are specific to Amazon Web Services
target.id          = ec2
ec2.endpoint       = eu-west-1.ec2.amazonaws.com
ec2.access.key     = YOUR_EC2_ACCESS_KEY
ec2.secret.key     = YOUR_EC2_SECRET_KEY
ec2.ami            = Your AMI identifier (ami-...)
ec2.instance.type  = t1.micro
ec2.ssh.key        = Your SSH Key
ec2.security.group = Your Security Group
	</code></pre>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Recipes - 3/3</h3>
	<p>
		The <strong>target</strong> installer is in charge of managing machines
		(VM, server, device...). The configuration depends on the target type.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <strong>bash</strong> installer manages the life cycle of a component
		through bash scripts (deploy, start, stop, undeploy and update). These scripts
		must be idempotent.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <strong>puppet</strong> installer manages the life cycle of a component
		through a Puppet module. The module name must start with <strong>roboconf_</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		These are the only available extensions for now.<br />
		But new ones can be easily created (Chef, ANT, custom one...).
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Instances - 1/2</h3>
	<p>
		Components define rules and relations (how).<br />
		Instances define what really runs (what and where).
	</p>
	<p>
		Unlike the graph, which was really a graph, instance definitions are trees.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="roboconf" data-trim>
# Deploy on EC2 VM (called VM1)
instance of VM_EC2 {
    name: VM1;
    instance of MyApp {
            name: MyApp_on_EC2;
    }
}

# Deploy on Openstack VM (called VM2)
instance of VM_Openstack {
    name: VM2;
    instance of MyApp {
            name: MyApp_on_Openstack;
    }
}
	</code></pre>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Instances - 2/2</h3>
	<p>
		Beyond specifying a name and its components, an instance
		can override the value of exported component properties.
	</p>
	<p>
		It can even define new properties that were not defined in the component.<br />
		This is useless with respect to exports, but it can be very useful in recipes.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="roboconf" data-trim>
# The Component
Tomcat {
	exports: ip, port = 8080;
}
	</code></pre>
	<pre><code class="roboconf" data-trim>
# An instance
instance of Tomcat {
	name: Tomcat;
	port: 8080;
	log_level: INFO;	# used in the recipe 
}
	</code></pre>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Application Descriptor</h3>
	<p>
		The application descriptor is a simple properties file with
		meta-data about the project itself.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="bash" data-trim>
# Application Descriptor for Roboconf
application-name = MyApp
application-qualifier = sample
application-description = A sample application

application-namespace = net.roboconf
application-dsl-id = roboconf-1.0

graph-entry-point = main.graph
instance-entry-point = initial-model.instances
	</code></pre>
