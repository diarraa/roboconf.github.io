<section>
	<h3>The LAMP Example</h3>
	<p>
		This is the classical example to introduce Roboconf.<br />
		It consists in deploying a standard stack made up of...
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>... a load balancer (here, an Apache server with modJK)...</li>
		<li>... an application server (Tomcat)...</li>
		<li>... and a database (MySQL).</li>
	</ul>

	<br /><br />
	<p>
		It illustrates both deployment and reconfiguration.<br />
		We use a very simple graph where web applications are installed with Tomcat (they are not in the graph, but part of the recipes).
	</p>
	<p>
		We also assume the deployment is performed on Amazon Web Services.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>The Graph</h3>
	<img src="../../resources/img/lamp-simple-graph.jpg" alt="Simplified graph" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		The Apache load balancer, Tomcat and MySQL can be deployed over a VM.<br />
		Tomcat needs a MySQL database. And the load balancer must be notified every time we deploy 
		an instance of of Tomcat.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tomcat is not the stand-alone server.<br />
		The recipe behind deploys both the server and at least a web application in it. This is to keep things simple
		for the example.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Instances Definition</h3>
	<p>
		We have our graph.<br />
		Let's assume we have the following set of instances in our model.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			VM 1 <small>(type: EC2 VM)</small>
			<ul>
				<li>Apache <small>(type: Apache)</small></li>
				<li>Tomcat 1 <small>(type: Tomcat)</small></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="clear"></p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			VM 2 <small>(type: EC2 VM)</small>
			<ul>
				<li>MySQL <small>(type: MySQL)</small></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<br /><br />
	<p>
		This is just a model, something we define in our configuration files.<br />
		Let's see what happens when we <strong>deploy all</strong>.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>VM Creation</h3>
	<img src="../../resources/img/lamp-scenario.jpg" alt="lamp scenario" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		The DM sends one creation request per VM.<br />
		The request contains the ID of the image template to instantiate, as well as the expected <i>flavour</i> (CPU, RAM...) for the VM.
	</p>
	<p>
		The virtual image contains an OS and a Roboconf agent with its configuration (RabbitMQ's IP...).
		Once the VM is up, the agent notifies the DM it is running.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>DM and Agent Interactions</h3>
	<p>
		Here is what happens when an agent is &laquo; up &raquo;.
	</p>
	<img src="../../resources/img/dm-to-agent.jpg" alt="Initial exchanges between the DM and an agent" class="no-border" />
</section>

<section>
	<h3>The special case of &laquo; Start &raquo;</h3>
	<p>
		An agent manipulates instances (associated to components).<br />
		An agent uses plug-ins to update the life cycle of an instance.
	</p>
	<p>
		But &laquo; plugin.start &raquo; does not start an instance.<br />
		It <strong>tries</strong> to start it. Before executing it, Roboconf checks
		all the runtime dependencies. If they are all satisfied, the plug-in can start.
	</p>
	<p>
		Otherwise, the instance will remain in <strong>starting</strong> until its
		dependencies are all resolved.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Before Synchronization</h3>
	<p>
		Let's get back to our example. So far, the VM have been created. Apache, Tomcat and MySQL have been deployed.
		But Tomcat does not know where MySQL runs. And Apache does not know where web
		applications are deployed.
	</p>
	<img src="../../resources/img/lamp-initial-deployment.jpg" alt="Initial deployment" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		In fact, while deployments progressively complete here and there,
		agents exchange information between them through RabbitMQ.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Variable Exchange - 1/6</h3>
	<p>
		Let's <strong>assume</strong> that Tomcat is the first deployed.
	</p>
	<img src="../../resources/img/lamp-variable-exchange-01.jpg" alt="Variable Exchange 1" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		First, the local agent starts listening those that need Tomcat variables.<br />
		Then, it requests the variables it needs (MySQL). It will not be able to start until 
		it has these variables. Since it is alone, nobody will answer its request.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Variable Exchange - 2/6</h3>
	<p>
		Let's <strong>assume</strong> Apache is deployed right after.
	</p>
	<img src="../../resources/img/lamp-variable-exchange-02.jpg" alt="Variable Exchange 2" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		First, the local agent starts listening those that need Apache variables.<br />
		Then, it requests the variables it needs (Tomcat). It will not be able to start until 
		it has these variables.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Variable Exchange - 3/6</h3>
	<p>
		The agent in charge of Tomcat receives the request sent by the Apache agent.
	</p>
	<img src="../../resources/img/lamp-variable-exchange-03.jpg" alt="Variable Exchange 3" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		But it is not started, it is missing variables.<br />
		So, it cannot publish its variables.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Variable Exchange - 4/6</h3>
	<p>
		Now, MySQL is up.<br />
		The graph states that the MySQL component / type does not have any dependency.
		So, it can directly start. 
	</p>
	<img src="../../resources/img/lamp-variable-exchange-04.jpg" alt="Variable Exchange 4" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		When it starts, it listens to those that could need it. And it publishes its variables.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Variable Exchange - 5/6</h3>
	<p>
		Tomcat (its agent) gets notified about MySQL.<br />
		All its dependencies are resolved and it can start.
	</p>
	<img src="../../resources/img/lamp-variable-exchange-05.jpg" alt="Variable Exchange 5" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		So, it can publish its variables.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Variable Exchange - 6/6</h3>
	<p>
		Eventually, Apache is notified about the Tomcat variables.<br />
		It can now start.
	</p>
	<img src="../../resources/img/lamp-variable-exchange-06.jpg" alt="Variable Exchange 6" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		Since it does not export any variable, it publishes nothing.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Parallel Deployments</h3>
	<p>
		Roboconf parallelizes everything it can.<br />
		Here, two flows were executed in parallel. 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Create VM 1, deploy Apache and Tomcat.</li>
		<li>Create VM 2 and deploy MySQL.</li>
	</ul>

	<br /><br />
	<p>
		While things were progressing, information was exchanged between agents, so that
		every instance could resolve its dependencies to start.
	</p>
	<p class="notice">
		No matter in which order deployments are performed,
		Roboconf guarantees everything will get synchronized and running
		at the end. This is achieved through asynchronous exchanges.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Resulting Deployment</h3>
	<img src="../../resources/img/lamp-result-1.jpg" alt="A LAMP deployment" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		Here is what we get at the end.<br />
		Let's now try to add a new Tomcat server.
	</p>
	<p>
		In our model, we define a new set of instances that we will deploy and start.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			VM 3 <small>(type: EC2 VM)</small>
			<ul>
				<li>Tomcat 2 <small>(type: Tomcat)</small></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Reconfiguration - 1/4</h3>
	<img src="../../resources/img/lamp-reconfiguration-01.jpg" alt="LAMP reconfiguration - 1" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		Once the new VM is created, the agent gets its model and deploys Tomcat.<br />
		Before starting it, it needs its dependencies.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Reconfiguration - 2/4</h3>
	<img src="../../resources/img/lamp-reconfiguration-02.jpg" alt="LAMP reconfiguration - 2" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		An instance of MySQL is already up and running.<br />
		It receives the request from the new Tomcat and publishes its variables.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Reconfiguration - 3/4</h3>
	<img src="../../resources/img/lamp-reconfiguration-03.jpg" alt="LAMP reconfiguration - 3" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		The new Tomcat gets the MySQL variables.<br />
		It can thus start and publish its own variables.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Reconfiguration - 4/4</h3>
	<img src="../../resources/img/lamp-reconfiguration-04.jpg" alt="LAMP reconfiguration - 4" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		An Apache load balancer is also up and running.<br />
		It is notified a new Tomcat is here. The associated agent executes the <strong>update</strong> recipe,
		which adds the new Tomcat in the load balancer configuration.
	</p>
	<p>
		Using one or all the Tomcat instances is specified in the recipes.<br />
		For a load balancer, we need to know ALL the instances. For a relational database, we 
		need to ONE instance (others are ignored). 
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Resulting Deployment</h3>
	<img src="../../resources/img/lamp-result-2.jpg" alt="Another LAMP deployment" class="no-border" />
	<p>
		The Apache load balancer can now dispatch requests to 2 Tomcat servers.<br />
		Both rely on the same database.
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
		Roboconf can deploy a distributed application <strong>in any order</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Parallelism is pushed to the limits. The asynchronous exchanges between agents guarantee that no
		matter what, the application will <i>land on its feet</i>.
	</p>
	<img src="../../resources/img/chat.gif" alt="a cat landing on its feet" />

	<p>
		This mecanism is used at deployment time as well as during reconfiguration phasis
		(addition or removal of application parts).
	</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h3>LAMP is the basic example</h3>
	<p>
		If one has to deploy a real LAMP stack, Roboconf fits.<br />
		However, a solution like <a href="https://juju.ubuntu.com/">Juju</a> (from Ubuntu) does it too, and probably in a more affordable way.
	</p>
	<p>
		But for complex applications or architectures, Roboconf brings a real value to teams.
		From this point of view, the LAMP example helps to understand the way it works.
