	<h3>Tooling</h3>
	<p>
		Beyond the way Roboconf is implemented, some choices
		have been made to make things simple. The syntax of 
		configuration files was chosen in this sense.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, tools are always helpful.<br />
		They help new users, and more generally, they make gain a lot of time.

	<h3>Maven Plug-in</h3>
	<p>
		Roboconf has its own Maven plug-in.<br />
		It helps to...
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>... validate the configuration files (graph, instances)...</li>
		<li>... package the project in a deployable archive...</li>
		<li>... insert Maven properties in configuration files.</li>
	</ul>

	<br /><br />
	<p>
		Ongoing work will allow testing and sharing reusable recipes.<br />
		Other tools will come later.
	</p>

	<h3>Eclipse Plug-in</h3>
	<p>
		Roboconf has also its own Eclipse plug-in.<br />
		It provides a creation wizard for new projects, and dedicated editors.
	</p>
