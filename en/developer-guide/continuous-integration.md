Continuous Integration (CI) is applied to almost all the Git repositories of Roboconf.  
On these repositories, every commit triggers a build that will compile the code and run the tests.

CI is hanled by [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/).  
The build is configured through a **.travis.yml** file, located at the root of the Git repository.

Our Java projects are generally built against 3 JDK: Oracle JDK 7, OpenJDK 7 and Oracle JDK 8.  
This kind of features is directly handled by Travis.


## Build Scenario

1. Clone the repository and run **mvn clean install**.
2. The Maven build is configured to run some checks.
3. Artifacts may eventually be deployed.

The checks include:

* Checkstyle verifications (about the well-formedness of the code).
* Dependencies analysis (to avoid cycles and version conflicts).

They rely on some resources.  
To avoid another project (and circular dependencies issues), these resources are hosted statically on Roboconf's web site.  
They are located under the **/resources/build/** directory.

## Deployment and Code Coverage

Some actions may be performed in case of successful build.  

* **Code coverage analysis** is handled by [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/).
* **Deployment** of the built artifacts to a Maven repository (hosted by [Sonatype](http://www.sonatype.org/)).

Since we build against 2 JDK, and that we do not want to perform these actions twice per build, we only
run them for the OpenJDK 7. These actions are defined in the **travis-build** and **travis-after-success.sh** scripts 
that are located at the root of the concerned projects.

The Maven deployment is run by the **mvn deploy** command.  
The Maven settings (where do we upload the artifacts, with which credentials) are specified [here](/resources/build/settings.xml).  
The CI server copies this *settings.xml* file and uses it at the end of the build to upload artifacts.

*env.USER_ID* and *env.USER_PWD* are replaced by the values that were specified in [Travis Settings](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/).  
More exactly, they are defined in the repository settings on Travis. These values are made available to the build if and only if a commit occurs.
It means no artifact will be uploaded if a pull request is proposed. But it will run if a pull request is accepted.

Artifacts are uploaded to the **snapshots Maven repository**. So, they are not synchronized with Maven Central.  
These artifacts have neither Javadoc, nor sources archives. And they are not signed.  
This is not a problem for snapshots. But this would not be suitable for a release.

## Build Outputs

Build results can be checked on [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)'s web site.  
In the case of **roboconf-platform**, the outputs are so big we also configured the Maven build to hide basic log entries.
Otherwise, the console output is truncated by Travis and this is a problem in case of build failure.
