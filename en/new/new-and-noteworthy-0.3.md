This page lists the enhancements and new features brought by Roboconf 0.3.


## Better Performances for Cloud Deployments

VM configuration is now made in background/asynchronous mode and in parallel.  
It results in much faster deployments when there are _a lot_ of virtual machines.

## Reusable Recipes

We have set up all the mechanics to define and reuse recipes.  
Recipes are defined and managed independently.

To use a recipe, reference its artifact...

... and import the graph definition.

## Documentation Generator

<img src="/resources/img/nn-0.3-doc.png" alt="An example of generated documentation" class="gs" />

We created a tool to generate documentation from your Roboconf applications.  
It comes with several options, output formats and languages.

## The Bash plug-in becomes the Script plug-in

We have extended the scope of the **Bash** plug-in to support any script.  
Bash, Shell, Perl and Python are just examples. But this gives quite a lot of new possibilities.
