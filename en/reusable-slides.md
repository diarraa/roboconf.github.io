A set of slides is available on this web site.  
You can reuse them for you presentations (training, courses, conferences...).  
You can also copy and adapt them for your own context.

**Short presentation** (use cases)

* Slides In English: 
[Presentation](/slides/general/roboconf-use-cases.html) - [Printing](/slides/general/roboconf-use-cases.html?print-pdf) - [PDF](/slides/general/pdf/roboconf-use-cases.pdf)

**Long presentation** (general and technical)

* Slides In English: 
[Presentation](/slides/general/roboconf-presentation.html) - [Printing](/slides/general/roboconf-presentation.html?print-pdf) - [PDF](/slides/general/pdf/roboconf-presentation.pdf)

They are based on [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js).  
You can copy the HTML page and remove or add sections.

> To print them, click the **printing** links.  
> Printing should rather be used with Chrome or Chromium. It is not guaranted to work on other web browsers.

Several style sheets (CSS) are available.  
But you can create and use your own one if you want.

* [Roboconf style](/slides/general/css/roboconf.css)
* [Linagora style](/slides/general/css/linagora.css)

To switch the style, update the CSS mark-up in the HTML presentation.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/roboconf.css" id="theme">
```

Diagrams were designed with [draw.io](https://www.draw.io).  
Slides and diagram sources are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/roboconf/roboconf.github.io/).

Eventually, you can generate PDF from this (or your derived) presentation.  
See the instructions on [reveal's readme](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js#pdf-export).
