## Listing Applications

This page lists all the applications.  
It provides a quick overview for every of them.

<br />

## Creating a New Application

<img src="/resources/img/web-admin-0.4-new-application.png" alt="Creating a new application" class="gs" />

Applications are all created from a skeleton (or application template).  
This template is a ZIP file to be uploaded. We also call it a *Roboconf application*.

<br />

## Listing Application Templates

<img src="/resources/img/web-admin-0.4-app-templates-listing.png" alt="Listing application templates" class="gs" />

Application templates are managed separately from applications.

<br />

## Listing Instances

<img src="/resources/img/web-admin-0.4-instances.png" alt="Listing instances" class="gs" />

For every application, we can list the instances of Software components that run within.

<br />

## Updating an Instance

<img src="/resources/img/web-admin-0.4-instance-state.png" alt="Updating an instance" class="gs" />

Updating an instance means acting on its life cycle.  
It can be about deploying it, start it, stopping it or undeploying it.
Reconfiguration is handled automatically by Roboconf.

<br />

## Creating Instances

<img src="/resources/img/web-admin-0.4-new-instances.png" alt="Creating instances" class="gs" />

It is possible to create new instances in an application.
