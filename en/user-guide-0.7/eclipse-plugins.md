There are Eclipse plug-ins for Roboconf.  
They include creation wizards for new Roboconf projects, text editors to edit configuration
files and even modeling tools to visualize and generate graphs.


## Installation

In Eclipse, click **Help &gt; Install New Software...**.  
Click **Add...** and complete the dialog that shows up.  
Give it a name, like `Roboconf's update site` and this URL: 
[http://dl.bintray.com/roboconf/roboconf-eclipse/0.7/](http://dl.bintray.com/roboconf/roboconf-eclipse/0.7/)

Click **OK**.    
Wait few seconds. An item containing **Roboconf** should appear. 


There are 2 Eclipse features.  
One contains basic support for Roboconf (creation wizard and editors). The second one contains modeling
tools. Pick up the features you need and click **Next**. Keep on clicking **Next** and **OK** until you
are asked to restart your Eclipse. Confirm. After the restart, the selected plug-ins are installed.
