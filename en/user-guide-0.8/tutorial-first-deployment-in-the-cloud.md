## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you to deploy the *LAMP* application from the
[Getting started with Roboconf](tutorial-getting-started-with-roboconf.html) tutorial.
The difference is that this time, you will deploy it to a real cloud infrastructure.

> It is assumed here that you followed this previous tutorial.  
> You are thus familiar with the DM and RabbitMQ's installation and configuration. 

In this tutorial, you will use your own cloud infrastructure.


## Plan

This tutorial is organized in 4 parts.

1. [Configuring the cloud infrastructure](tutorial-first-deployment-in-the-cloud-1.html).
2. [Installing the Roboconf agent](tutorial-first-deployment-in-the-cloud-2.html).
3. [Deploying the application](tutorial-first-deployment-in-the-cloud-3.html).
4. [Going farther](tutorial-first-deployment-in-the-cloud-4.html).

For the moment, this tutorial only documents the use of Amazon Web Services.  
Others will be added later. Let's start with [the first step](tutorial-first-deployment-in-the-cloud-1.html).
