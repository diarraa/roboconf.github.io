Roboconf has a target implementation for VMWare.  
It only supports the creation of *compute* VMs.

To install it, open the DM's interactive mode and use one of the following options.  
With the [roboconf:target](karaf-commands-for-roboconf.html) command:

```properties
# The version will be deduced automatically by the DM
roboconf:target vmware
```

Or with the native Karaf commands:

```properties
# Here in version %v_SNAP%
bundle:install --start mvn:net.roboconf/roboconf-target-iaas-vmware/%v_SNAP%
```

> VMWare support depends on your version.  
> What will most likely happens is that Roboconf will have several VMWare extensions, one per VMWare version.

Sample **target.properties**.  
Just copy / paste and edit.

```properties
# Configuration file for VMWare
handler = iaas-vmware
name = 
description = 

# REST URL
vmware.url = 

# Credentials to connect
vmware.user	= 
vmware.password	= 
vmware.ignorecert = true

# Cluster information
vmware.datacenter = 
vmware.cluster = 
vmware.vmuser = 
vmware.vmpassword = 

# VM configuration
vmware.template =  
```
