Both the DM and the agent distributions rely on Apache Karaf.  
And they both include a web server with an administration console.

This console is, by default, available at [http://localhost:8181/system/console](http://localhost:8181/system/console).  
Default credentials are **karaf** / **karaf**.

This console provides several menus, including the bundle administration...

... the HTTP contexts...

...  and the iPojo objects.

By default, the port is 8181. When you start one of the Karaf distributions for the first time, a **jetty.xml**
file is created under Karaf's **etc** directory. You can change the port and other web settings by editing this
file. This configuration is also used by the DM's web administration.
