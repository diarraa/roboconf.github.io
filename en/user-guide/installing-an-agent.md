A Roboconf agent is an OSGi application which is in charge of executing instructions on the host it is deployed on.  
These instructions are either given by the DM, or deduced by the agent from a change in the global application.
As an example, if there is a web application on the host, and that it depends on a database, and that the database
is undeployed, then the agent will stop the web application.

> The instructions, as well as the notifications, all go through the messaging server.

A Roboconf agent is associated to a given application.  
And more specifically, it is tied to a single *root instance* in this application. A *root instance* designates a machine in Roboconf's DSL.
So, an agent will undertake and communicate about all the applications parts that are deployed on the same host than it.

To install a Roboconf agent, you must have:

* A Java Virtual Machine (JDK) for Java 1.7.  
OpenJDK and Oracle JDK are supported.

* Bash if you want to use the **Bash** plug-in.

* Puppet if you want to use the **Puppet** plug-in.  
Make sure you have a recent version of Puppet. See [this page](plugin-puppet.html)
for more information about Puppet installation. Puppet **must** be installed on the virtual image.

Although we generally test Roboconf with Ubuntu systems, there is no reason it does not work on other systems.  
However, **we recommend using Linux systems**.

Several options are available to install an agent.
 
* Deploy our predefined OSGi distribution for the agent.
* Deploy the agent as a Karaf feature on your own Karaf server.
* Deploy the agent's bundles in an OSGi container.

> This page only describes how to install an agent.  
> Take a look at [this page](configuring-an-agent.html) to see how to configure it.


# Root Access

The agent will install and modify applications on the host.  
To run correctly, the **agent must run with root privileges**.

Besides, an agent should be configured to start with the machine / VM.  
This is necessary if you deploy in a cloud environment.

On Linux systems, making a program start with the operating system can be achieved a **init.d** script.  
You can also edit the **/etc/rc.local** file and launch the program at the end of the script.

If you use Karaf, there are commands to automatically register the server as a service.  
And if you install the Debian package, all of this is handled automatically for you.


# Installing Java

Installing Java is described in several places all over the web.  
Here are some short links and snippets to make you gain some time.
Take a look at [this page](http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/java) as an example.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk 
```

And define the **JAVA_HOME** environment variable.  
On Ubuntu 14.04, the following command installs Java here...

	/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre

If you use Karaf, you can define this variable in the Karaf's **bin/setenv** file.


# The Custom Karaf Distribution for the Agent

[Apache Karaf](http://karaf.apache.org/) is an OSGi server.  
It brings additional features to OSGi containers like Felix (Apache) or Equinox (Eclipse). It also allows to build custom distributions
with pre-installed bundles and their configurations. The custom Karaf distribution for the agent is thus a stand-alone server with the
Roboconf's agent being already deployed and configured. It is configured to run with [Apache Felix](http://felix.apache.org/).

> Having several Karaf servers on a machine can result in port conflicts.
> If it is your case, you may have to configure the ports differently. 
> Or you may prefer deploying our Karaf feature.

This distribution can be deployed either with a Debian package or manually.  
To deploy it manually, you must have a JDK 7 installed. Then, [download the agent's ZIP archive](../download.html)
and unzip it somewhere on your disk. 

To start it, execute...

```bash
cd bin
sudo ./karaf
```

This opens an interactive shell.  
To exit, type in...

```bash
logout
```

You can find help and more instructions about Karaf on [its web site](http://karaf.apache.org/).  
Anyway, you need to make Karaf start at boot time with the system. Fortunately, Karaf has very useful
features such as [system wrappers](http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/).

```properties
# Start the agent
cd bin
sudo ./karaf

# Install the service wrapper
feature:install service-wrapper

# Create a service for the agent
wrapper:install -n roboconf-agent

# Exit Karaf
logout

# Install the service
sudo ln -s /home/ubuntu/roboconf-karaf-dist-agent-0.9/bin/roboconf-agent-service /etc/init.d/

# Configure it to boot with the system
sudo update-rc.d roboconf-agent-service defaults

# Just to be sure, you can check the main script
more ../etc/roboconf-agent-wrapper.conf
```

Now, restart your system and make sure the agent runs.  

Note: you can test directly the installation, by running "sudo /etc/init.d/roboconf-agent-service start", and checking the "data/log/wrapper.log" file. If you get some trouble finding the JVM:
- Determine where it is ("update-alternatives --config java")
- In the etc/roboconf-agent-wrapper.conf file, set the set.default.JAVA_HOME property accordingly with the location of your JVM (in the path displayed by the "update-alternatives" command, take the first part, removing "/jre...").

When everything looks fine, then, reboot:

```properties
# Clear the logs (you were in the "bin" directory).
cd ../data/log
rm -rf *

# Restart.
sudo reboot

# Reconnect to the VM through SSH (...).
# Check the logs.
cd roboconf-agent/data/log

# If the agent is running, there will be logs.
```


# The Agent Feature for Karaf

If you already have your own Karaf server, you may prefer to install the agent as a feature.  
The agent feature is a XML file that lists the bundles to install and some of their dependencies so that the agent works.

We do not have any official release yet.  
However, you can add our snapshot repository to the list of features repository.

Start your karaf and execute...

```properties
# Add the feature URL
feature:repo-add http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/roboconf/roboconf-karaf-feature-agent/0.9/roboconf-karaf-feature-agent-0.9-features.xml

# Install the feature 
feature:install roboconf-agent
```

For the record, the **roboconf-agent** feature depends on the following features:

* **ipojo-all** since Roboconf bundles use iPojo.
* **config** since the agent can be reconfigured through *Config Admin*.


# The Agent Bundles

It is possible to deploy the agent bundles directly in Felix, Equinox or any other OSGi container.  
To determine all the required bundles, take a look at the Karaf feature described above. The previous section
also lists their dependencies (as other Karaf features).
