Roboconf has a target implementation for OCCI (currently experimental, developed under the hood of OCCIWare R&D project).

It supports the creation of VMs, starting from a VM image, and is under developments with tests on top of VMWare and ActiveEon IaaS, and backed by a Erocci OCCI server.

To install the OCCI target, open the DM's interactive mode and use one of the following options.  
With the [roboconf:target](karaf-commands-for-the-dm.html) command:

```properties
# The version will be deduced automatically by the DM
roboconf:target occi
```

Or with the native Karaf commands:

```properties
# Here in version 0.8
bundle:install --start mvn:net.roboconf/roboconf-target-iaas-occi/0.8
```

Sample **target.properties**.  
Just copy / paste and edit.

```properties
# Configuration file for OCCI
handler = iaas-occi
id = a unique identifier
name = 
description = 

# OCCI server location
occi.serverIpPort = 172.16.225.91:8080

occi.image = RoboconfAgentImageName
occi.title = occiware test
occi.summary = test for occiware

# Credentials to connect (if any)
occi.user	= 
occi.password	= 
 
```
